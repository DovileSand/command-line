Grep is used to search for specific things, like strings, files, characters, patters when combined with ls, cat.
It is possible to use pipe to redirect output to grep, so that it worked with the text from the input stream instead of the file we gave it as an argument.
Using grep I have to specify what am I looking for.
It searched only in the directory I am in, not subdirectories.

grep binary *.txt
To search if word binary is contained inside the file.
Grep command takes two parameters: first what you want to search for (word binary), second what files you want to search through (in this case “combined”).

Doviles-Air:Text_Files Admin$ cat Learn_to_code.txt | grep “z"

Above example prints only lines of text that contain letter “z”.
